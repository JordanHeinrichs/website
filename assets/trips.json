      "In April 2019 I ran the 123rd Boston Marathon. I had qualified 10 months earlier in Calgary with the time of 2:59:45. I had set my sights on Boston a few years earlier after I completed my first marathon.",
      "This was my first marathon major and by far the biggest race I have participated in. I found myself marveling at the logistics they had for getting all 30,000 runners to the start point 42 km away from the finish line.",
      "The race went pretty well. I was aiming for 2:50 but perhaps I was a bit too aggressive during the early crowded parts of the race. By km 35 I was just trying to hold it together. Finished in 2:53:47."

      "This was my first time camping on snow and being on a glacier. I was entirely under qualified to be there. There is something special the Columbia Icefields, maybe it is just the scale but there is it spectacular to be up there.",
      "THe first day with we setup camp just above the Athabasca then did the long walk over to Kitchener on a bluebird day. The next day was Snowdome and ski out in a whiteout."

      "In June 2019 shortly after my wife graduated we went down to Ecuador for 3 weeks to explore and climb some volcanos. Our sights were set on climbing Chimborazo, the peak furthest from the center of the Earth.",
      "We picked a 10 day acclimatization program which covered several of the other volcanos gradually working our way up to the end goal of +6000 m elevation. When we were not climbing we stayed in a small town called Machachi and ate wonderful food.",
      "Along the way we summited Coraz√≥n, Illiniza Norte, and Cotopaxi. The refuge at Cotopaxi was luxurious but unfortunately the combination of suspected food poisoning, harsh weather, and altitude on the climb resulted in the next few days basically bedridden.",
      "When it came time to try for Chimborazo I had been living on Gatorade and did not have the strength to do it. Turned around after just a few hours in. The rest of the time in Ecuador was exploring beaches and experiencing great hospitality."

      "I went out a bit hard in the race and struggled during the second half but overall it went fairly well. Finished in just under 17 hours."
